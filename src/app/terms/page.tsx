        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">About This Website</h2>
        <p>
          Best London Tours (bestlondontours.co.uk) is an affiliate website that recommends tours and
          attractions in London. We do not sell tickets directly. When you click a booking link on our
          site, you are redirected to a third-party provider (such as GetYourGuide) where the transaction
          takes place.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          We earn a commission on bookings made through links on our site. This does not affect the price
          you pay. Our recommendations are based on ratings, reviews, and quality, not on commission rates.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">Pricing and Availability</h2>
        <p>
          Prices shown on our site are approximate and may change without notice. Final pricing,
          availability, and booking terms are determined by the tour provider. We make every effort
          to keep information accurate but cannot guarantee it at all times.
        </p>
