        <p>
          We do not require you to create an account or provide personal information to use our site.
          We may collect anonymous usage data through:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Google Analytics: anonymous browsing data including pages visited, time on site, and device type</li>
          <li>Vercel Analytics: anonymous performance and usage data</li>
          <li>GetYourGuide: when you click an affiliate link, GetYourGuide may set cookies to track the referral</li>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          Our site uses cookies for analytics and affiliate tracking. These are:

          <li>GetYourGuide cookies: used to attribute bookings to our affiliate account</li>
        </ul>

          You can also disable cookies in your browser settings at any time. Note that disabling cookies

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">Cookie Consent</h2>
        <p>
          On your first visit, we display a cookie consent banner at the bottom of the screen. You can
          choose to accept all cookies or limit usage to essential cookies only. Your preference is stored

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">Affiliate Links and Commission Tracking</h2>
        <p>
          Our site contains affiliate links to GetYourGuide and other booking platforms. When you click
          an affiliate link, the booking provider may place a cookie in your browser to attribute the
          referral to our site. If you complete a booking, we earn a small commission at no extra cost
          to you. This is how we fund the site and keep it free for all visitors.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">GetYourGuide Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>
          GetYourGuide is our primary affiliate partner. When you interact with GetYourGuide content or
          click a booking link on our site, GetYourGuide may set cookies to track the referral and improve
          your booking experience. These cookies are governed by GetYourGuide&apos;s own privacy policy, which
          you can review on their website. We do not have access to the personal data GetYourGuide collects
          through these cookies.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">Third-Party Links</h2>
        <p>
          Our site contains links to third-party booking providers (primarily GetYourGuide). When you click
          these links, you leave our site and are subject to the privacy policies of those providers. We
          encourage you to read their privacy policies before providing any personal information.

          Under UK GDPR, you have the right to access, rectify, or delete any personal data we hold about
          you. Since we do not collect personal data directly, this is unlikely to apply. If you have
